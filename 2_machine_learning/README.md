# 2. Machine Learning-Based Drug Development

## Abstract

Artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery has garnered significant attention for its potential to **reduce the time and cost** associated with **developing novel therapeutics**. With **advancements in deep learning technology** and the **expansion of drug-related data**, numerous **deep learning methodologies** are now being applied **across all stages of the drug development process**. **<sup>1</sup>**

This literature review introduces **key machine learning concepts**, **notations**, and **supervised learning algorithms** essential for drug discovery applications. Additionally, it presents a case study demonstrating the application of **regression algorithms**, specifically **Random Forest** and **LightGBM regressors**, through interactive **JupyterLab exercises**. These exercises provide practical insights into leveraging machine learning models for **predicting molecular properties and reactions**, thereby facilitating **more efficient and effective drug development workflows**.
