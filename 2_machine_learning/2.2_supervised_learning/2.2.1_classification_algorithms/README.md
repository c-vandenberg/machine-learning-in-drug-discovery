# 2.2.2 Classification Algorithms in Supervised Learning

## 1) Decision Trees

**Decision Trees** is a supervised learning method for **classification of discrete input data** (although it can also be used in **prediction of continuous input data via regression**).

Decision tree algorithms use a **branching sequence of linked decisions** that can be represented with a **tree data structure**. These decision tree data structures can then **predict the result of an input vector based on decision rules inferred from the features present in the data**. **<sup>1</sup>**

Decision trees are useful because they are **easy to visualise, validate and audit**, so that you can **understand the factors that lead to a result**.
