# 1.1 Molecular Graph Theory

## 1.1.1 Introduction To The Molecular Graph Representation

Some of the most prevalent machine-readable molecular representations are built on the concept of the molecular graph representation. It is therefore important to introduce the theory behind molecular graphs and gain a solid understanding of it. This will primarily involve the abstract mathematical structure/data structure of the graph itself; however, it is important to note that notations and file formats such as **SMILES strings** and **Molfiles** are also built using molecular graphs. **<sup>1</sup>**

Molecular graph representation is based on the concept of **mapping a molecule's atoms and bonds into sets of nodes and edges**. Typically, the nodes are represented using letters indicating the atom type (as per the periodic table), or simply using points where the bonds meet (for carbon atoms). **<sup>1</sup>**

A molecular graph representation is formally a **2D object** that can be used to **represent 3D information/spatial relationships**. For example, a molecular graph can contain information such as **atomic coordinates**, **bond angles** and **chirality**. However, because graph nodes only show **pairwise relationships**, this spatial information must be **encoded as node and/or edge attributes**. **<sup>1</sup>**

Typically, in schematic representations of graphs, the nodes are represented using circles or spheres, and the edges using lines (**Fig 1**). The 2D and 3D representations of graphs can be visualised by many software packages, such as **ChemDraw**, **<sup>2</sup>** **Avogadro**, **<sup>3</sup>** and **VMD** **<sup>4</sup>**

## 1.1.2 Mathematical Defintion of a Graph

A graph is formally/mathematically defined as a **tuple** *G=(V, E)* of a **set of nodes** *V*, and a **set of edges** *E*, where each edge element *e* in set *E* (*e ∈ E*) **connects a pair of nodes v** from set *V* (*v ∈ V*).

Intuitively, we can think of set *V* as being a set of **all atoms in the molecule**, and set *E* being a set of **all bonds in the molecule**. This is typically the convention, but it **does not have to be the case**.

Molecular graphs are typically **undirected**, meaning the **pairs of nodes that define each edge are unordered/the edges are bidirectional**.

In order to construct a concrete, programmatic representation of a graph from this abstract mathematical concept, we need to **map the sets of nodes and edges to linear data structures**. Common data structures used to do this are **arrays** or **matrices**. A linear data structure is required in order to **specify the connectivity of the nodes**. Therefore, despite the fact that the ordering in the sets is irrelevant, an **artificial node-ordering is required** in order to **encode a molecule using arrays or matrices**. 

The molecular information to be mapped to the graph can be:
1. How atoms are connected in the molecule
2. The identity of the atoms
3. The identity of the bonds

### How atoms are connected in the molecule - Adjacency Matrix

The most common representation for **how the atoms are connected** in a molecule is an **adjacency matrix** (sometimes known as a **connectivity matrix**, **Fig 2b**). An adjacency matrix works as follows:
1. For adjacency matrix **A**, *a<sub>ij</sub>* is an element of **A**
2. If *a<sub>ij</sub> = 1*, then a **bond exists** between nodes *v<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>j</sub>* in molecular graph *G*
3. If *a<sub>ij</sub> = 0*, then a **bond does notexists** between nodes *v<sub>i</sub>* and *v<sub>j</sub>* in molecular graph *G*
4. **N.B** An adjacency matrix only specifies a bonds exists, it does not specify what type of bond exists

### The Identity of Atoms - Node Features Matrix

The most common representation for **the identity of atoms** in a molecule is a **node features matrix** (**Fig 2c**), which works as follows:
1. For node features matrix **X**, each **row** of **X** corresponds to a node *v<sub>i</sub>* (i.e. an **atom in the molecule**) in molecular graph *G*
2. This row is also referred to as the **node feature vector** *x<sub>i</sub>* for that atom
3. The **length** of *x<sub>i</sub>* corresponds to the **number of atom features** you have chosen to encode
4. For example, in **Fig 2c**, a **one-hot encoding** of atom type and formal charge has been chosen (i.e. the atom types and formal charges are represented as a **binary value** so that they can be **fed into machine-learning (ML) algorithms**)

### The Identity of Bonds

The most common representation for **the identity of bonds** in a molecule is a **edge features matrix** (**Fig 2d**), which works as follows:
1. For edge features matrix **E**, each **row** of **E** corresponds to an edge *e<sub>ij</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub>,v<sub>j</sub>)* (i.e. the **bond between atoms i and j**) in molecular graph *G*
2. This row is also referred to as the **edge feature vector** *e<sub>ij</sub>* for that edge
3. The **length** of *e<sub>ij</sub>* corresponds to the **number of bond features** you have chosen to encode
4. For example, in **Fig 2d**, a **one-hot encoding** of possible bond types {single, double, triple, aromatic} has been chosen

### One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding is a technique in data science whereby **categorical data is converted into a binary vector**. It is common in ML algorithms as it helps to **preserve information and improves prediction**, and **makes the dataset compatible with various types of ML algorithms**. This is because many ML algorithms **cannot work with categorical data directly**, and require all input and output variables to be **numeric**.

Therefore, with one-hot encoding, **each unique category value is assigned a binary vector** that has **all zero values**, except for the **index of the category**, which is given a value of **1**.

The main drawback of one-hot encoding is that it can lead to a **large increase in data dimensionality**, especially if the categorical variable has many categories. This is often referred to as the **curse of dimensionality**. **<sup>6</sup>**

## 1.1.3 Graph Traversal Algorithms

As discussed before, although graphs themselves are **non-linear data structures** made up of sets of nodes and edges, in practice, **matrix representations of graphs are node order dependent**. **<sup>1</sup>**

The node order used in a matrix representation is determined by a **graph traversal algorithm** (**Fig 3**). It is often important to **reliably and consistently generate the same matrix representation of the same molecule**, and this is dependent on **generating the same node order** each time. Therefore, the way in which the graph traversal algorithm **breaks ties** when a node branches off must be consistent so that the algorithm **consistently selects the same branch traversal order**.

To achieve this consistency, a **depth-first** or **breadth-first** search algorithm can be used. If however, consistency is not important, a **random search** algorithm can be used.

correspond to the order in which the nodes are explored, starting at node 1. <b>a</b> A depth-first search first explores each “branch” of a graph to the
fullest extent, then goes back and explores branches at the last branched node, until all branches have been explored. <b>b</b> A breadth-first search first
explores all nearest neighbours of a node, and then the nearest neighbours of the nearest neighbours, and so on, until the whole graph has been
explored. <b>c</b> A random search explores nodes in the graph in an arbitrary order, regardless of how they are connected <b><sup>1</sup></b>

## 1.1.4 Molecular Graph Reprentations

The matrix representations discussed in **1.1.2** are **not the only way to represent graphs**. As discussed in **1.1.3**, depending on **what graph traversal algorithm is used**, the **order of the rows in the atom/bond block will be different**.

Indeed, when constructing molecular graphs, there is not one correct way to represent any molecule and the representation chosen must be appropriate for the task. **<sup>1</sup>**

## 1.1.5 Advantages of Molecular Graph Representations

**3D Information**:
  * Despite being **2D** data structures with no spatial relationships between elements, we can **encode 3D information into a graph representation**
  * For example, **node (atomic) information** such as **stereochemistry** can be encoded into the **node features matrix, X**, and **edge (bond) information** such as **bond length** can be encoded into the **edge features matrix, E**
  * The fact that **3D** information can be naturally encoded in a graph representation gives graphs **many advantages over various types of linear notations** such as SMILES strings (however, some linear notations such as **SYBYL Line Notation** can also encode atomic 3D information) **<sup>1</sup>**

## 1.1.6 Disadvantages of Molecular Graph Representations

**Delocalised, Polycentric, Ionic & Metal-Metal Bonds**
  * There are many types of molecules which **cannot be described by the graph model**
  * This includes a structure containing any form of **delocalised bonds** (e.g. coordination compounds), a molecule containing **polycentric bonds** (e.g. **3c-2e bonds**), **ionic bonds** or **metal-metal bonds**
  * For example, organometallic compounds such as **metallocenes** or **metal carbonyl compounds** are not well described by molecular graphs because the **haptic** and **synergic bonds** respectively **cannot be explained by the simple, atomic pairwise relationship in valence bond theory** **<sup>1</sup>**

**Dynamic Bonds**
  * For molecules where bonds are broken and formed frequently or if their structure is constantly rearranging (e.g. **tautomers**), a single molecular graph representation would not be appropriate

**Memory Efficiency**
  * Molecular graphs are **extremely memory inefficient** and their memory requirement increases with the **square of the number of nodes** at least
  * They are also **not compact** as data structures and become **more difficult to traverse/search as they get bigger**
  * This is one of the **main advantages of linear notations** such as **SMILES strings** and **molecular fingerprints** over molecular graphs; they are **much more compact and memory-efficient** representations for molecules and are widely used for **basic cheminformatic analysis**

## 1.1.7 Molecular Graphs in AI-Driven Small Molecule Drug Discovery

### Representation Learning

Many molecular representations, such as molecular graphs, are used in **representation learning** applications in deep learning.

Representation learning is the idea of **learning an internal representation** (e.g. a **vector**) for a **given object** (e.g. a **molecule**) and then using that internal representation for a **predictive task**. These internal representations are **learned**, meaning models can be **trained to create them** using **backpropagation** in neural networks.

With representation learning tasks, it is key is to first **identify a suitable input representation of a molecule** that contains **as much of the desirec/necessary information to solve the problem as possible** **<sup>1</sup>**

### Graph Neural Networks

The development of graph neural networks has resulted in a a proliferation of work whereby the molecular graph representation is used directly for **molecular property prediction**, **<sup>7</sup>**  **molcular graph generation**, **<sup>8</sup>** and **synthesis prediction**. **<sup>9</sup>** 

Most of these applications use **graph representation learning**, by which a **learned molecular graph embedding** is obtained from inputting molecular grapoh representations into a graph neural network. These learned molecular graph embeddings can then be used as input into a **property prediction model** such as a **random forest** or **deep neural network (DNN)** in the same way as a **classical molecular fingerprint** (*cf.* **1.2.6**)
